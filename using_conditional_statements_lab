# Using Conditional Statements Lab
The goal of this lab is to build a terminal based car simulator, with inputs for the state the car is in (engine off or on),
which gear the car is currently in, how fast the car is moving, and and in order to receive those outputs, including a Scanner
that will allow for user input via the keyboard.

## Step 1: declaring the variables for each component of the simulator
- ```java boolean startCar = false;
        String gear = "P";
        int speed = 0;
        int choice = 0;
        Scanner keyBoard = new.Scanner(System.in);
```

## Step 2: Adding print statements for the menu including each component of the simulator
- ```java System.out.println("------ Car Dashboard ______");
        System.out.println("Speed: " + speed);
        System.out.println("Gear: " + gear);
        System.out.println("placeholder_for_choice" + choice);
```

## Step 3: Adding print statements for the options available to the user (implementing the while loop)
- For this step, I want to use a value not equal to any of the choices available for each of the actions in the simulator (1-4) so
I'm going to use 5 for my starting point.


## Step 4: Prompt the user for input
- ```java System.out.println("Enter your choice: ");
     choice = keyBoard.nextInt();
```

## Step 5: Use a switch statement to check the code according to what the user inputs
- ```java switch(choice) {
            case 1:
                isEngineOn = !isEngineOn;
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Enter gear (P, D, R");
                gear = keyBoard.next();
                break;
            case 3:
                if (isEngineOn && !gear.equals("P")) {
                    speed += 10;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Cannot accelerate while engine is off or in Park.");
                }
                break;
            case 4: //this is for the acceleration option. So if the user is in the "drive" gear and wants to go faster, use speed += 10;
